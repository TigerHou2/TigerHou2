## :wave: Hello!

My name is Linyi (Tiger) Hou and I am an AeroE grad student at UIUC. My current research focuses on solving the lost in space and time problem using variable stars. Some of my active and past projects can be found here. [[Curriculum Vitae](https://tigerhou2.github.io/cv/cv.pdf)]

In the meantime, check out my other projects, such as [a videogame implemented on an FPGA](https://github.com/TigerHou2/ece385_FinalProject#readme) or [a life-sized, remote controlled R2D2](https://github.com/TigerHou2/R2D2#readme)!
