## :wave: Hello!

My name is Linyi (Tiger) Hou and I am an AeroE grad student at UIUC. My current research focuses on deep space navigation using x-ray pulsars and velocity-based initial orbit determination. This repo contains my published research work as well as other projects I have worked on. [[My CV](/linyi_hou_cv.pdf)]

In the meantime, check out my other projects, such as [a videogame implemented on an FPGA](https://github.com/TigerHou2/ece385_FinalProject#readme) or [a life-sized, remote controlled R2D2](https://github.com/TigerHou2/R2D2#readme)!
